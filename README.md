First practice HTML

This project serves as a proof of learned knowledge during the HTML course in The Odin Project

By the end of the project I should have demonstrated skills regarding the HTML foundations such as working with elements and tags, HTML boilerplate, lists, images and links

This is also an opportunity to test the learned git basics
