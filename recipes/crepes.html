            <li>In a large bowl, add whole eggs, sour or mineral water, milk and mix everything well</li>
            <li>Add lemon (grated rind of unsprayed lemon) rum as desired (definitely recommend to put) then smooth flour, vanilla sugar, sugar and salt</li>
            <li>Mix everything well and let the pancake mixture stand for 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the pancake pan well, preferably with a non-stick base</li>
            <li>Coat a hot pan with a brush and very little oil, then put about 1 dl of pancake mixture, so that it finally turns out thin and you end up with 20 pieces of pancakes</li>
            <li>Fry one side for about half a minute, turn over and continue to fry the other side of the pancake for about 20 seconds</li>
            <li>And the recipe for 20 pieces of pancakes is ready and ready to serve</li>
        </ol>
